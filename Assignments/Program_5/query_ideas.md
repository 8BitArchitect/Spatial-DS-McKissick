### Ideas
#### Easy
- Determine closest city/airport to each volcano
#### Intermediate
- Determine the shortest path required to visit each volcano once
#### Challenging
- Plan a "world tour" to visit each volcano once, taking into account the nearest local/regional/international airports that must be traveled through and nearest city for lodging.
